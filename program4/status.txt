Program Status: Complete

The program has been successfully implemented with the following features:
- TCP client and server that simulate a 3-way handshake
- Raw TCP header creation and parsing
- Proper sequence number handling
- Command line port number specification
- Proper display of both raw header bytes and readable header fields

The program correctly implements all requirements of the assignment. The client and server can communicate using raw TCP headers for the 3-way handshake protocol, and they display all required information.

Testing has been done on a Unix system, and all functionality works as expected.
